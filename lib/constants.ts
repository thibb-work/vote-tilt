/**
 * How often a phone republishes where it is pointing, and therefore how long a
 * dot on the host has before the next position arrives.
 *
 * It lives here because the host's easing has to be the same number. A shorter
 * ease makes the dots stutter -- arrive, stop, wait -- and a longer one piles
 * lag on top of lag, so globals.css reads it from --dot-travel rather than
 * carrying a second copy that can drift.
 *
 * It was 300ms because Supabase Realtime Presence, the transport this app used
 * to run on, capped out around twenty messages a second. RTDB has no such
 * ceiling and the database sits in europe-west1, a 15ms round trip away, so the
 * cap outlived the only reason it existed.
